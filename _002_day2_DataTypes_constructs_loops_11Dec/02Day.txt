Good Morning guyz....
Hope everyone has completed their assignments
Have you done with Hands-On labs (assignment 1 word file).

Day2 topics

1> Data types and Strings in java
2> constructs (if-else,is else-if,switch)
3> loops (for,while,do while)
4> how to create a class ( instance variables)

instead of putting on mute someone has put me on hold.
kindly be sensible .... this way i will not be able to conduct the session properly....

how many primitive data types we have in java( 8 data types)
byte - 1b, 0
short -2b, 0
int - 4b,  0
long -8b(postfix the listeral with 'l' or 'L') 0
(if the size of long literal exceed then it will give error)
,float - 4 b(postfix the listeral with 'f' or 'F') 0.0
(coz all decimal are by default double in java)
double - 8b 0.0
char - 2b , '\u0000'
boolean 1bit (true /false 0/1) false

local variables - variable within method scope .argument/parameters are also local variables

rule for local variales:
-must be initialized before use
-camelCase
-do not have default value

numeric literals java 7 onwards can have '_' underscore which is avoided by the compiler and meant for readibility purpose

bytecote ??
compiled code (.class file) which makes java platform independent
